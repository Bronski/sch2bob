This tool converts .schematic files (NBT) to .bo2. NBT files are gzipped, but this tool won't do that for you.

Sample use:

    for i in *.schematic; do gunzip < "$i" > "`echo \"$i\" | sed s/.schematic$/.gunzipped/`"; done
    ./sch2bob *.gunzipped
    rm *.gunzipped

Alternatively, if you have a whole heap of these things and not enough disk space, the following may work better:

    for i in *.schematic; do
        gunzip < "$i" > tmp.gunzipped
        ./sch2bob tmp.gunzipped
        mv tmp.bo2 "`echo \"$i\" | sed s/.schematic$/.bo2/`"
    done
    rm tmp.gunzipped

You should now have a directory full of .bo2 files.

Inspired fully by github.com/mispy's sch2bob.rb; I just made it faster.
