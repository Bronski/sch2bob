This tool converts .schematic files (NBT) to .bo2. NBT files are gzipped, but this tool won't do that for you.

Sample use:

for i in *.schematic; do gunzip < "$i" > `echo "$i" | sed s/.schematic$/.gunzipped/`; done
./sch2bob *.gunzipped
rm *.gunzipped

sch2bob removes the extension, so you should now have a directory full of .bo2 files.

Inspired fully by github.com/mispy's sch2bob.rb; I just made it faster.
